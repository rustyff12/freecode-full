# Find the Symmetric Difference

The mathematical term symmetric difference (`△` or `⊕`) of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the two sets but not in both. For example, for sets `A = {1, 2, 3}` and `B = {2, 3, 4}`, `A △ B = {1, 4}`.

Symmetric difference is a binary operation, which means it operates on only two elements. So to evaluate an expression involving symmetric differences among three elements `(A △ B △ C)`, you must complete one operation at a time. Thus, for sets `A` and `B` above, and `C = {2, 3}`, `A △ B △ C = (A △ B) △ C = {1, 4} △ {2, 3} = {1, 2, 3, 4}`.

Create a function that takes two or more arrays and returns an array of their symmetric difference. The returned array must contain only unique values (no duplicates).
